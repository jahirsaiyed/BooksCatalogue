        "* Participants will be able to articulate the essential steps and components of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system and implement a standard RAG system using langchain.\n",
        "* Participants will gain familiarity in inspecting the execution pathways of LLM-based systems.\n",
        "* Participants will gain familiarity in approaches for the evaluation of LLM-based systems."
